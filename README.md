# js-framework

This is a tiny framework for me to use for future projects. It implements routing and dynamic HTML management which enables dynamic URL variables and expandable development.

## To Use

Clone the repository, make a `routes.js` file by either renaming the example or making a new file based on the example. Add a script tag below framework script tag for the `routes.js` file.

### Notes

- The HTML for the page is not loaded until the preload functions have completed.
- If you are providing just CSS or just JS for a page, you need to put both JS and CSS properties for the route.
